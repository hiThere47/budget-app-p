line 26 code was crucial in maintaining css integrity

2/7/2025: so now i'm going to work on a universal storage practice to just
put out a reasonably usable version


1. Local Storage (Best for Simplicity & Persistence)
How it works: Stores key-value pairs in the browser and persists even after closing the browser or shutting down the computer.
Pros:
Easy to use (localStorage.setItem() and localStorage.getItem()).
Data persists until manually cleared (no need to open the console).
Cons:
Only stores strings (you must JSON.stringify() objects before saving).
Limited to around 5MB per domain.

2. IndexedDB (Best for Large & Structured Data)
How it works: A client-side NoSQL database built into browsers.
Pros:
Can store large amounts of data (hundreds of MBs).
Supports structured data (objects, arrays, blobs, etc.).
Cons:
More complex API compared to localStorage.
Data persists until manually deleted.
Use when: You need to store large datasets, complex structures, or offline web applications.

3. Server-Side Storage (Best for Long-Term & Cross-Device Persistence)
How it works: Stores data on a remote server (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, Firebase).
Pros:
Data is accessible across multiple devices.
No storage limits like local browser storage.
Cons:
Requires backend setup.
Needs internet access.
Use when: You want user data to persist across multiple devices or sessions.

Which is Best for You?
If you just want to store simple data that persists across browser sessions, use Local Storage.
If you need to store large structured data (like todo lists or settings), use IndexedDB.
If you want data to be saved across multiple devices, use server-side storage.


Looks like i'm going to use the IndexedDB
